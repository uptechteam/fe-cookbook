## General information

Feature-based architecture is an architectural approach that organizes code and project structure around the features or functionalities of an application rather than grouping them by the traditional architecture layers (e.g., presentation, business logic, data access). In a feature-based architecture, each feature of the application is treated as a self-contained module, containing all the necessary components, business logic, and data handling related to that specific feature.

The main characteristics of a feature-based architecture include:

1. **Modularity**: Features are self-contained and isolated from one another. This makes it easier to understand, maintain, and test individual features without affecting the rest of the application.

2. **Loose Coupling**: Features are loosely coupled, meaning they interact with each other through well-defined interfaces or APIs. This reduces interdependencies and helps to avoid code entanglement.

3. **Scalability**: New features can be added to the application without disrupting existing features. Each feature can be developed and tested independently, making it easier to scale the application as it grows.

4. **Reusability**: Features can be reused in other parts of the application or even in different projects. This promotes code reuse and saves development time.

5. **Collaboration**: In larger projects, different teams can work on different features simultaneously, which improves development efficiency and enables parallel work.

6. **Domain-Driven Design (DDD) alignment**: Feature-based architecture aligns well with the principles of Domain-Driven Design, where the codebase is organized based on the business domain.

Feature-based architecture is commonly used in modern frontend development, especially in large-scale web applications. It is often seen in frameworks like Angular, where Angular Modules provide a natural way to create feature-based architectures. However, it can also be applied to other frontend frameworks, such as React and Vue.js.

With feature-based architecture, developers can focus on building and maintaining specific features in isolation, leading to a more maintainable and scalable codebase. It helps to avoid the problem of "spaghetti code" that can occur in monolithic architectures, where features and functionalities are tightly coupled, making it challenging to modify or extend the application over time.

In this example, we have organized the codebase using a feature-based architecture, where each feature (e.g., `user`, `products`) is treated as a separate module within the `features` directory.

Each feature directory contains subdirectories to organize different aspects of the feature:

- `components/`: Contains presentational components related to the feature.
- `containers/`: Contains container components that connect the presentational components to the Redux store and handle logic.
- `actions/`: Holds action types and action creators specific to the feature.
- `reducers/`: Contains reducers for managing the state of the feature.
- `services/`: Contains service files related to the feature (e.g., API calls, data handling).

The `shared/` directory contains shared components that can be used across different features.

The `utils/` directory holds utility files, such as API functions, authentication functions, and validation utilities.

The `redux/` directory contains the Redux store configuration.

The `assets/` directory holds images and icons used in the application.

Please note that this is a simplified example, and in a real-world project, the file structure may be more extensive, including additional directories for routes, constants, tests, and more. The key idea behind a feature-based architecture is to group related functionality together in a modular and isolated way, leading to a more maintainable and scalable codebase.
