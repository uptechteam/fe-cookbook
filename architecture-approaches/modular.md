## General information

Module architecture, also known as modular architecture, is an approach to software design and development that emphasizes the use of small, self-contained, and reusable modules. In this context, a module is a discrete unit of functionality or code that performs a specific task or provides a particular feature. Each module is designed to be independent and can be easily combined with other modules to build complex systems.

The main objectives of module architecture are:

1. **Modularity**: The system is broken down into smaller, manageable pieces (modules), each responsible for a specific functionality. This makes the codebase easier to understand, test, and maintain.

2. **Reusability**: Modules are designed to be reusable, meaning they can be utilized in multiple parts of the application or even in different projects. This reduces redundant code and development time.

3. **Encapsulation**: Modules hide their internal implementation details and expose only the necessary interfaces or APIs. This ensures that other parts of the application can interact with a module without needing to know how it works internally.

4. **Scalability**: As the application grows, new modules can be added or existing ones modified without affecting the entire codebase. This facilitates the ability to scale the application in a more manageable way.

5. **Dependency Management**: Modules often have well-defined dependencies, which makes it easier to manage and update dependencies within the application.

6. **Code Organization**: With module architecture, the codebase is organized into a structured hierarchy, making it easier for developers to navigate and locate specific functionalities.

Module architecture is commonly used in various programming paradigms, including object-oriented programming, functional programming, and component-based architectures (e.g., React and Angular). In these paradigms, modules are typically represented as classes, functions, components, or packages, depending on the programming language or framework.

Many modern programming languages and frameworks provide features to support modular architecture, such as package managers (e.g., npm for JavaScript), import/export statements, and dependency injection.

Overall, module architecture fosters maintainable, scalable, and reusable codebases, making it a favored approach in software development for building robust and efficient systems.
